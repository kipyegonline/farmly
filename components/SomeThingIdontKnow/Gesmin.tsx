        Humans are more sensitive to the "Smell of Rain" than sharks are to
        blood. You know that earthy, fresh scent that rises from the Kenyan red
        soil the moment the first raindrops hit after a dry spell? It’s called
        Petrichor, and our ability to detect it is one of the most extreme
        sensory feats in the animal kingdom. The Science: Geosmin The smell
        actually comes from a compound called Geosmin, produced by soil-dwelling
        bacteria (Actinomycetes). When rain hits the ground, it traps tiny air
        bubbles that then pop, shooting Geosmin into the air like a natural
        aerosol. The "Something You Don't Know" Part: Hyper-Sensitivity: Humans
        can detect Geosmin at concentrations as low as 5 parts per trillion. The
        Comparison: To put that in perspective, a shark—famous for its sense of
        smell—can detect one part of blood per million parts of water. That
        means we are significantly more sensitive to the smell of wet soil than
        a Great White shark is to blood.
